# Minute Papers for 432 in Spring 2023

During the semester, Professor Love will set a series of "minute papers" which are brief surveys asking you to help us better understand how the class is going, and to let us remind you of some things. The first Minute Paper is due after Class 3.

## Course Participation Grades

Details on how course participation is evaluated are provided in the Syllabus. As indicated there, the most common ways to earn additional class participation besides the Minute Papers are:

1. completing "bonus" tasks Dr. Love offers during the semester, so keep your eyes open for these opportunities
2. asking and answering useful questions on Campuswise, and **in class sessions**, and 
3. finding typos in the materials and helping Dr. Love to fix them
